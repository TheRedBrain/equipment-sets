# Equipment Sets

This mod adds equipment sets that provide a bonus when an entity has items of a set equipped.

This mod is an API for mod and data pack authors. It does nothing on its own.

## Configuration

Equipment sets are defined via data packs. You can see an example in the [test mod](https://github.com/TheRedBrain/equipment-sets/tree/1.20.1/src/testmod/resources/data/equipmentsets_test).
